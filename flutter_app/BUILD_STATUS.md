# Health Genie Build Status

## Completed Tasks âœ…
1. **Device Setup**
   - iPhone 12 connected and recognized by Flutter
   - Developer Mode enabled on iPhone 12
   - Device paired with Xcode
   - Apple Watch 7 paired with iPhone 12

2. **Development Environment**
   - CocoaPods installed via Homebrew
   - Pod dependencies installed successfully
   - Xcode project configured with your Apple ID
   - Code signing set up with Personal Team

3. **Code Fixes**
   - Updated health package API calls for compatibility
   - Fixed HealthFactory initialization (was Health)
   - Fixed HealthDataType.SLEEP_ANALYSIS to SLEEP_ASLEEP
   - Fixed NumericHealthValue conversions
   - Fixed Stream.periodic asyncMap implementation
   - Fixed getHealthDataFromTypes parameter order

## Current Status ðŸ”„
- Build process initiated but taking longer than expected
- This is likely due to first-time compilation of all dependencies

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹
When you return:

1. **Try running from Xcode directly:**
   - Open Xcode if not already open
   - Select iPhone 12 from device dropdown
   - Press Cmd+R to build and run
   - Watch for any error messages

2. **Alternative: Run from command line:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   flutter run -d "00008101-001D44303C08801E"
   ```

3. **Once app is running on iPhone 12:**
   - Grant HealthKit permissions when prompted
   - Check if Apple Watch data is being received
   - Verify 15-second data collection cycle
   - Test the dashboard UI and health scores

## Troubleshooting Tips ðŸ”§
- If keychain password prompt appears: Use your Mac login password
- If "Untrusted Developer" error on iPhone: Settings â†’ General â†’ VPN & Device Management â†’ Trust your certificate
- If build fails: Check Report Navigator in Xcode (Cmd+9) for specific errors

## Health Package API Reference
The health package (v9.0.1) has these key differences from newer versions:
- Use `HealthFactory` instead of `Health`
- `getHealthDataFromTypes` takes parameters in order: startTime, endTime, types
- Health values are wrapped in `NumericHealthValue` with `.numericValue` property
- No `configure()` method needed
- Use `hasPermissions()` instead of `isHealthDataAvailable()`

Sleep well! The app is very close to running successfully. ðŸŒ™
