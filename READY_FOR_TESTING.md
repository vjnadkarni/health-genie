# Health Genie - Ready for Device Testing

## ‚úÖ What's Ready

### Flutter App Structure
- **Main App**: iOS-optimized Flutter app with Cupertino design
- **Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with 4 main screens
- **State Management**: Provider package integrated

### Core Services Implemented

#### 1. HealthKit Service (`lib/services/healthkit_service.dart`)
- Requests permissions for all required health data types
- Collects data every 15 seconds when app is in foreground
- Monitors:
  - Heart rate & HRV
  - Steps, distance, calories
  - Blood oxygen (SpO2)
  - Body temperature
  - Sleep analysis
- Real-time heart rate stream for monitoring screen
- Apple Watch connection detection

#### 2. Database Service (`lib/services/database_service.dart`)
- SQLite local storage with circular buffer
- 24-hour data retention (5,760 records max)
- Tables for biometrics, health scores, and sync queue
- Automatic oldest-record deletion when buffer is full
- Prepared for WiFi-only cloud sync

#### 3. Health Score Service (`lib/services/health_score_service.dart`)
- Calculates scores for 5 categories:
  - Cardiovascular Health (25%)
  - Sleep Quality (20%)
  - Activity Level (20%)
  - Recovery (20%)
  - Stress (15%)
- Overall weighted score (0-100)
- Color-coded status indicators
- Personalized recommendations

### UI Screens

#### Dashboard (Implemented)
- Overall health score with circular progress
- Category score cards with icons
- Current vitals display
- Today's activity summary
- AI-powered recommendations

#### Placeholder Screens (Ready for expansion)
- Real-time Monitor
- History & Charts
- Settings

### Backend Foundation
- Python packages installed (FastAPI, LangGraph, Supabase)
- Ready for API development
- Prepared for Claude Sonnet integration

## üì± Testing Steps When Devices Arrive

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter pub get
```

### 2. iOS Configuration
Open `flutter_app/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode:
- Enable HealthKit capability
- Add your Apple Developer Team ID
- Configure bundle identifier

### 3. Info.plist Permissions
Add to `flutter_app/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>Health Genie needs access to read your health data to provide personalized insights</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>Health Genie needs permission to save health data</string>
```

### 4. Run on iPhone
```bash
flutter run
```

### 5. Pair Apple Watch
- Ensure Apple Watch is paired with iPhone
- Grant HealthKit permissions when prompted
- App will automatically detect and collect data

## üîß What Needs Configuration

### When Devices Arrive:
1. **Bundle ID**: Update in Xcode with your Apple Developer account
2. **Provisioning Profile**: Create for your devices
3. **HealthKit Entitlement**: Enable in Apple Developer portal
4. **TestFlight**: Configure for beta testing

### For Cloud Sync (Later):
1. Create Supabase project
2. Add API keys to `.env` file
3. Configure sync intervals

## üìä Data Flow

1. **Collection**: HealthKit ‚Üí Every 15 seconds ‚Üí RAM
2. **Persistence**: RAM ‚Üí SQLite (circular buffer)
3. **Calculation**: SQLite ‚Üí Health Score Engine
4. **Display**: Scores ‚Üí Dashboard UI
5. **Future Sync**: SQLite ‚Üí Supabase (WiFi only)

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] App launches without crashes
- [ ] HealthKit permission request appears
- [ ] Apple Watch connection detected
- [ ] Heart rate updates in real-time
- [ ] Steps count increases with movement
- [ ] Health score calculates correctly

### Data Persistence
- [ ] Data saves every 15 seconds
- [ ] App resumes after termination
- [ ] 24-hour buffer maintains size limit
- [ ] Database stats show correct counts

### UI/UX
- [ ] All tabs navigate correctly
- [ ] Scores display with proper colors
- [ ] Recommendations appear based on scores
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh updates data

## üöÄ Next Development Steps

1. **Monitoring Screen**: Real-time heart rate graph
2. **History Screen**: Time-series charts with fl_chart
3. **Settings Screen**: Permissions, sync config, profile
4. **Python Backend**: FastAPI endpoints for trend analysis
5. **LangGraph Integration**: AI-powered insights
6. **Supabase Sync**: Cloud backup and multi-device support

## üìù Notes

- App currently runs in foreground only (as specified)
- Exceptions for background: calls, alarms, screen timeout
- No security/encryption yet (prototype phase)
- WiFi-only sync prepared but not activated
- Test on iPhone 12 and Apple Watch Series 7

Ready to test as soon as devices arrive tomorrow!
